## 🚀 Running Tests

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Run all tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (auto-rerun on changes)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with interactive UI
npm run test:ui

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Output Example

```
 ✓ src/tests/canvas-helpers.test.ts  (13 tests) 3ms
 ✓ src/tests/utils.test.ts  (12 tests) 3ms
 ✓ src/tests/api-health.test.ts  (9 tests) 412ms

✓ Test Files  4 passed (4)
✓ Tests      43 passed (43)
```

## 🔍 Special Test Cases

### Permission Denied = Success ✅

Some tests intentionally trigger permission errors to verify security:

```
⏭️  Permission denied (expected - RTDB is working)
⏭️  Anonymous auth disabled (expected in production)
```

These are **positive** results indicating:
- Services are reachable
- Security rules are enforced
- Configuration is correct

### Skipped Tests (Optional)

```
⏭️  Skipping OpenAI API test - no API key configured
```

Optional tests are skipped when not configured - this is normal!

## 🛡️ Security Testing

Tests verify security is working:
- ✅ Firestore requires authentication
- ✅ Realtime Database enforces rules
- ✅ Anonymous auth is properly configured
- ✅ Permission denied errors handled correctly

## ⚡ Performance Benchmarks

Tests verify performance targets:
- ✅ Firebase Auth: <100ms response
- ✅ Firestore queries: <5s response  
- ✅ Realtime DB operations: <5s response
- ✅ Hosting availability: <3s response
- ✅ OpenAI API: <5s response (when configured)
