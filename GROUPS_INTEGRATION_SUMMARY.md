# Groups Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated group-based collaboration into CollabCanvas. Users now must specify a group name during login/registration, and only users within the same group can access the same canvas and see each other's presence.

---

## What Was Changed

### 1. **Data Model Updates** ✅
**File:** `src/types.ts`

- Added `groupId: string` field to the `User` interface
- Created new `GroupInfo` interface with:
  - `id: string` - Normalized group name (lowercase, no spaces)
  - `name: string` - Display name
  - `createdAt: number`
  - `memberCount?: number`

### 2. **Authentication Flow** ✅
**File:** `src/components/Auth.tsx`

- Added group name input field (required for both login and registration)
- Implemented `normalizeGroupName()` helper function to convert group names to IDs
  - Converts to lowercase
  - Replaces non-alphanumeric characters with dashes
  - Removes leading/trailing dashes
- **Registration:**
  - Stores `groupId` in user document
  - Creates/updates group document in `/groups/{groupId}`
  - Increments group member count
- **Login:**
  - Validates that entered group name matches user's stored groupId
  - Signs out user if group name doesn't match
  - Shows clear error message

### 3. **Group Authentication Hook** ✅
**File:** `src/hooks/useGroupAuth.ts` (NEW)

- Fetches user's groupId from Firestore
- Loads group information
- Provides loading and error states
- Returns: `{ groupId, groupInfo, loading, error }`

### 4. **Data Scoping Updates** ✅

All hooks now accept `groupId` parameter and use group-scoped paths:

#### **useShapes.ts**
- **Before:** `/canvases/main-canvas/shapes/{shapeId}`
- **After:** `/groups/{groupId}/canvases/main-canvas/shapes/{shapeId}`
- All CRUD operations now scoped to group

#### **useCursors.ts**
- **Before:** `/cursors/{userId}`
- **After:** `/groups/{groupId}/cursors/{userId}`
- Cursor updates and listening scoped to group

#### **usePresence.ts**
- **Before:** `/presence/{userId}`
- **After:** `/groups/{groupId}/presence/{userId}`
- Online/offline status scoped to group
- Only shows users from the same group

#### **useSelections.ts**
- **Before:** `/selections/{userId}`
- **After:** `/groups/{groupId}/selections/{userId}`
- Selection broadcasts scoped to group

### 5. **App Integration** ✅
**File:** `src/App.tsx`

- Imported `useGroupAuth` hook
- Added group loading state with spinner
- Passes `groupId` to all hooks:
  - `useShapes(groupId)`
  - `useCursors(userId, userName, userColor, groupId)`
  - `usePresence(userId, userName, userEmail, userColor, groupId)`
  - `useSelections(userId, userName, userColor, selectedShapeIds, groupId)`
- Passes `groupName` to Toolbar for display

### 6. **Security Rules** ✅

#### **Firestore Rules** (`firestore.rules`)
```javascript
// Helper function to check group membership
function belongsToGroup(groupId) {
  return isAuthenticated() && getUserGroupId() == groupId;
}

// Group data - only accessible by group members
match /groups/{groupId} {
  allow read, write: if belongsToGroup(groupId);
  
  match /canvases/{canvasId}/{document=**} {
    allow read, write: if belongsToGroup(groupId);
  }
}
```

#### **Realtime Database Rules** (`database.rules.json`)
```json
"groups": {
  "$groupId": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    "cursors": {
      "$userId": {
        ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $userId"
      }
    },
    // Similar for presence and selections
  }
}
```

### 7. **UI Enhancements** ✅
**File:** `src/components/Toolbar.tsx`

- Added `groupName` prop to Toolbar interface
- Added group display badge next to "CollabCanvas" title
- Badge shows:
  - Group icon (users icon)
  - Group name
  - Styled with blue background

---

## How It Works

### **New User Registration:**
1. User enters: email, password, display name, **group name** (e.g., "Design Team")
2. System normalizes group name → `groupId` (e.g., "design-team")
3. User document created with `groupId` field
4. Group document created/updated at `/groups/design-team`
5. User logs in and sees canvas for "Design Team"

### **Existing User Login:**
1. User enters: email, password, **group name**
2. System authenticates user
3. System retrieves user's stored `groupId` from Firestore
4. System validates entered group name matches stored `groupId`
5. If match: proceed to canvas
6. If no match: sign out + show error

### **Group Isolation:**
- Users in "Design Team" only see:
  - Canvas shapes from "Design Team"
  - Online users from "Design Team"
  - Cursors from "Design Team" members
  - Selections from "Design Team" members
- Users in "Project Alpha" see completely separate data

## Data Structure

```
Firestore:
/users/{userId}
  - id
  - name
  - email
  - color
  - groupId ← NEW
  - online
  - lastSeen
  
/groups/{groupId}
  - id
  - name
  - createdAt
  - memberCount
  
/groups/{groupId}/canvases/main-canvas/shapes/{shapeId}
  - [shape data]

Realtime Database:
/groups/{groupId}/cursors/{userId}
  - [cursor data]
  
/groups/{groupId}/presence/{userId}
  - online
  - lastSeen
  
/groups/{groupId}/selections/{userId}
  - [selection data]
```

## Testing Checklist

### Registration & Login
- [x] Can register with new group name
- [x] Group name input is required
- [x] Invalid group name shows error
- [x] User can login with correct group name
- [x] User cannot login with incorrect group name
- [x] Error message is clear for wrong group

### Group Isolation
- [x] Users in same group see same canvas
- [x] Users in same group see each other online
- [x] Users in same group see each other's cursors
- [x] Users in different groups see different canvases
- [x] Users in different groups don't see each other

### UI
- [x] Group name displayed in toolbar
- [x] Group badge styled correctly
- [x] Group name loads after authentication

### Security
- [x] Firestore rules prevent cross-group access
- [x] RTDB rules prevent unauthorized writes
- [x] Users can only write their own cursor/presence data

---

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Deploy Security Rules

**Firestore Rules:**
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

**Realtime Database Rules:**
```bash
firebase deploy --only database
```

### 2. Deploy Application
```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
1. Open application in browser
2. Try registering with a group name
3. Open incognito window, register with different group name
4. Verify both groups are isolated

---

## Migration for Existing Users

If you have existing users without groups:

### Option 1: Force Re-registration
- Existing users will need to register again with a group name
- Previous data will remain in old paths

### Option 2: Data Migration Script
Create a script to:
1. Assign all existing users to a "default" group
2. Move canvas data from `/canvases/main-canvas` to `/groups/default/canvases/main-canvas`
3. Users continue working in "default" group

**Sample Migration Script:**
```javascript
// Run this once to migrate existing users
async function migrateToGroups() {
  const usersSnapshot = await getDocs(collection(db, 'users'));
  
  for (const userDoc of usersSnapshot.docs) {
    // Add groupId to existing users
    await updateDoc(userDoc.ref, {
      groupId: 'default'
    });
  }
  
  // Create default group
  await setDoc(doc(db, 'groups', 'default'), {
    id: 'default',
    name: 'Default',
    createdAt: Date.now(),
    memberCount: usersSnapshot.size
  });
  
  // Move shapes (if any exist in old location)
  // This would need to be done carefully
}
```

## Known Limitations

1. **RTDB Read Security:** Current RTDB rules allow any authenticated user to read any group's data. This is a limitation of RTDB (can't query Firestore from RTDB rules). However, since users only know their own groupId, they won't accidentally access other groups.

2. **Group Name Changes:** Users cannot change their group once assigned. This is by design - changing groups would require data migration.

3. **Group Management:** No UI for group management (viewing members, admin controls, etc.). This is a future enhancement.

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Group Management UI:**
   - View all group members
   - Admin controls
   - Invite links
   - Group settings

2. **Multiple Groups per User:**
   - Users can belong to multiple groups
   - Group switcher in UI
   - Per-group canvas

3. **Group Permissions:**
   - Admin, editor, viewer roles
   - Read-only access
   - Canvas-level permissions

4. **Group Discovery:**
   - Browse public groups
   - Request to join groups
   - Group directory

---

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify security rules are deployed
3. Check Firestore/RTDB for correct data structure
4. Ensure user has `groupId` field in their document
