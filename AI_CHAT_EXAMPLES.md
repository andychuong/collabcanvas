Use these color names in your commands:
- **red** - `#FF0000`
- **blue** - `#0000FF`
- **green** - `#00FF00`
- **yellow** - `#FFFF00`
- **orange** - `#FFA500`
- **purple** - `#800080`
- **pink** - `#FFC0CB`
- **black** - `#000000`

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific**: "Create a red circle at 300, 200" works better than "make a circle"

2. **Use Coordinates**: The canvas is approximately 1000x700 pixels, with center around 500, 350

3. **Reference by Properties**: 
   - By type: "the circle", "the rectangle"
   - By color: "the red circle", "the blue text"
   - By content: "the text that says 'Welcome'"

4. **Break Down Complex Tasks**:
   - Instead of: "Create a complete dashboard"
   - Try: "Create a login form" then "Add a welcome message at the top"

5. **Iterate**: Build complex layouts step by step
   ```
   Create a 3x3 grid of squares
   Add text "Board Game" at 200, 100
   Create a red circle in the center
   ```
