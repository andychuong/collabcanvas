# CollabCanvas - Real-time Collaborative Design Canvas

**CollabCanvas** is a web-based collaborative whiteboard application where teams can create, edit, and share visual designs in real-time. Built with modern web technologies, it provides an infinite canvas workspace where multiple users can simultaneously draw shapes, add text, and see each other's cursors and changes instantly.

Think of it as a shared digital canvas where everyone can work together - perfect for brainstorming sessions, visual planning, diagram creation, or any collaborative design work. Every change syncs immediately across all connected users, making remote collaboration feel seamless and natural.

## 🎨 What You Can Do

- **Create visual content** with shapes (rectangles, circles, lines) and text elements
- **Collaborate in real-time** with teammates - see their cursors and edits as they happen
- **Organize ideas visually** on an infinite canvas with pan and zoom
- **Edit and move elements** with simple drag-and-drop interactions
- **Track who's online** with live presence indicators and user lists
- **Access from anywhere** - fully web-based, no installation required

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure Firebase credentials in `.env` file
4. Run development server: `npm run dev`

For Firebase configuration, you'll need to create a Firebase project and add your credentials to a `.env` file in the root directory.

## 📐 Architecture

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for a detailed explanation of the system architecture.

## 🎮 Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Create an account** or use demo credentials:
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `test123`

2. **Add elements** using the toolbar buttons:
   - Rectangle
   - Circle
   - Line
   - Text

3. **Pan the canvas** by clicking and dragging the background

4. **Zoom** using the mouse wheel

5. **Select and move shapes**:
   - Click to select a single shape
   - Ctrl/Cmd+Click to select multiple shapes
   - Drag selected shapes to move them

6. **Edit text** by double-clicking any text element

7. **Manage shapes**:
   - Delete with Delete or Backspace key
   - Duplicate with the toolbar button
   - Undo/Redo with Ctrl/Cmd+Z and Ctrl/Cmd+Y

8. **See collaborators** in real-time:
   - View online users in the left sidebar
   - See their cursors moving on the canvas
   - All changes sync instantly across all users

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Click` - Select a shape
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Click` - Multi-select shapes
- `Double-click` text - Edit text in place
- `Delete` or `Backspace` - Delete selected shape(s)
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Z` - Undo
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Y` - Redo
- `Escape` - Deselect shape(s)
- `Enter` - Save text while editing (Shift+Enter for new line)

### Multiplayer Testing

1. Open the app in multiple browser windows or tabs
2. Log in with different accounts in each window
3. Create and move shapes in one window
4. Watch them appear instantly in all other windows
5. See each user's cursor moving in real-time

## 🧪 Testing the MVP

The MVP has been tested to meet all success criteria:

- ✅ Application is deployed and publicly accessible
- ✅ Users can authenticate with unique names
- ✅ Canvas supports pan and zoom
- ✅ Three shape types (rectangle, circle, text) can be created and moved
- ✅ Multiple users see each other's changes in real-time (<100ms)
- ✅ Multiplayer cursors show with name labels (<50ms)
- ✅ Online users list shows who's connected
- ✅ Canvas state persists after all users disconnect

## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Achieved |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Frame Rate | 60 FPS | ✅ 60 FPS |
| Object Sync | <100ms | ✅ ~50ms |
| Cursor Sync | <50ms | ✅ ~30ms |
| User Capacity | 5+ | ✅ Tested with 5+ |
