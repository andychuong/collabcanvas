# CollabCanvas - Real-time Collaborative Design Canvas

**CollabCanvas** is a web-based collaborative whiteboard application where teams can create, edit, and share visual designs in real-time. Built with modern web technologies, it provides an infinite canvas workspace where multiple users can simultaneously draw shapes, add text, and see each other's cursors and changes instantly.

Think of it as a shared digital canvas where everyone can work together - perfect for brainstorming sessions, visual planning, diagram creation, or any collaborative design work. Every change syncs immediately across all connected users, making remote collaboration feel seamless and natural.

## üé® What You Can Do

- **Create visual content** with shapes (rectangles, circles, lines) and text elements
- **Collaborate in real-time** with teammates - see their cursors and edits as they happen
- **Organize ideas visually** on an infinite canvas with pan and zoom
- **Edit and move elements** with simple drag-and-drop interactions
- **Track who's online** with live presence indicators and user lists
- **Access from anywhere** - fully web-based, no installation required

> **üìã Full Feature Set Implemented!** All planned features have been successfully implemented.
