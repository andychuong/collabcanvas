# CollabCanvas - Real-time Collaborative Design Canvas

**CollabCanvas** is a web-based collaborative whiteboard application where teams can create, edit, and share visual designs in real-time. Built with modern web technologies, it provides an infinite canvas workspace where multiple users can simultaneously draw shapes, add text, and see each other's cursors and changes instantly.

Think of it as a shared digital canvas where everyone can work together - perfect for brainstorming sessions, visual planning, diagram creation, or any collaborative design work. Every change syncs immediately across all connected users, making remote collaboration feel seamless and natural.
