# CollabCanvas Groups - User Guide

## What Are Groups?

Groups allow teams to have their own private collaborative canvas. Only users within the same group can:
- See and edit the same canvas
- See each other online
- See each other's cursors in real-time
- Collaborate on shapes

## Group Names

### Tips for Choosing a Group Name

‚úÖ **Good Group Names:**
- "Design Team"
- "Project Alpha"
- "Marketing 2024"
- "Engineering Team"

‚ùå **Avoid:**
- Very long names (they'll be truncated in the UI)
- Special characters (they'll be converted to dashes)

### How Group Names Work

- Group names are **case-insensitive** (e.g., "Design Team" = "design team")
- Spaces and special characters are normalized (e.g., "Design Team!" becomes "design-team")
- All team members must use the **same group name** to access the same canvas

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I belong to multiple groups?
**A:** Currently, each user account is associated with one group. To work with multiple groups, you would need separate email accounts.

### Q: Can I change my group name?
**A:** No, the group name is set during registration and cannot be changed. If you need to switch groups, you'll need to create a new account.

### Q: What if I forget my group name?
**A:** Unfortunately, there's no way to recover your group name. You'll need to ask a teammate or create a new account.

### Q: Can I see a list of all members in my group?
**A:** Yes! Look at the top-right corner of the toolbar. You'll see colored circles with initials representing each online team member.

### Q: What happens if two people edit the same shape?
**A:** The last person to finish editing wins. The app uses a "last write wins" approach, so changes are always synchronized in real-time.

### Q: Is there a limit to how many people can be in a group?
**A:** No limit! Your entire team can collaborate together.

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid group name for this account"
**Problem:** You're trying to log in with a different group name than you registered with.

**Solution:** Make sure you're entering the EXACT group name you used during registration. Check with your teammates if you're unsure.

### "I can't see my teammates"
**Possible causes:**
1. They're using a different group name
2. They're not logged in
3. They're on a different canvas

**Solution:** Verify everyone is using the same group name.

### "My changes aren't showing up"
**Possible causes:**
1. Network connectivity issue
2. Not logged in
3. Wrong group

**Solution:** 
- Check your internet connection
- Refresh the page
- Verify you're in the correct group

## Best Practices

### For Team Leads
1. **Decide on a group name** before your team registers
2. **Share the exact group name** with all team members (case doesn't matter, but spelling does)
3. **Keep a record** of the group name somewhere safe

### For Team Members
1. **Copy-paste the group name** from your team lead to avoid typos
2. **Use the same group name** every time you log in
3. **Stay logged in** to see real-time updates from teammates

### For Collaboration
1. **Communicate** what you're working on to avoid conflicts
2. **Use different areas** of the canvas for different tasks
3. **Check who's online** before making major changes
4. **Save frequently** (the app auto-saves, but it's good to be aware)
